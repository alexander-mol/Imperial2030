Factories, territories & bonds as classes?
Implement factory deactivation
why don't we ever get to the second clause of unit movement - going to highly connected spot
make the log file a lot nicer
what are the most time consuming steps?
ships should move after tanks - player strategy
better unit direction by using maximum flow algorithm (unit - ship - ship - target) - ship vertices have capacity 1


DONE:
proper random seed that works
Log file in test ??
Sending tanks to water
put on github
weird none stuff in paths
clean up the path routing stuff (None, None)
Make units into classes - things are nicer that way
