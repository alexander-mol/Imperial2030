Factories, territories & bonds as classes?
make the log file a lot nicer
what are the most time consuming steps?
better unit direction by using maximum flow algorithm (unit - ship - ship - target) - ship vertices have capacity 1
implement null hypothesis skipping in evolver
make sure that guys can't have negative money from skipping on the rondel
clean up game.py


DONE:
proper random seed that works
Log file in test ??
Sending tanks to water
put on github
weird none stuff in paths
clean up the path routing stuff (None, None)
Make units into classes - things are nicer that way
Auto kill when a factory produces with an enemy on it? - No because it can't produce
Implement factory deactivation
why don't we ever get to the second clause of unit movement - going to highly connected spot
make flag counting faster - it's actually a significant drag
ships should move after tanks - player strategy
