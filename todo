do we ever send ships to land?
Breakage when unit 'goes to' original location - e.g. doesn't move - gives 'no path'
should make some more tests for path routing stuff
Implement factory deactivation
Make units into classes - things are nicer that way
Factories & bonds as classes?
make the log file a lot nicer
put on github
clean up the path routing stuff (None, None)
what are the most time consuming steps?
better unit direction by using maximum flow algorithm (unit - ship - ship - target) - ship vertices have capacity 1


DONE:
proper random seed that works
Log file in test ??
Sending tanks to water
